  A directory containing PyTorch projects and examples, cleaned and organized for easy understanding.  

- **`tensorflow`**:  
  Basic image classification task using TensorFlow.  

- **`value_iteration_algorithm`**:  
  Implementation of the value iteration algorithm.  

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries required for individual projects are specified in their respective notebooks or scripts.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mzums/machine-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd machine-learning
   ```

3. Set up the environment by installing the required libraries. 

   Example for creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
